PythonTesting

An example Python script used to showcase what I've learned so far.<br/>

This program takes in a persons name, their hourly pay, and the average length of their typical work week. Using these the program calculates and displays how much this person would make in one week and how much this person would make in one 52-week year.
<br/>

This program implements several imported packages and a custom person class. I would also like to add a data persistence feature in the future through different branches. A flat file systems, and a structured database system if possible.
